## About
sflow is a mutable stream library for Scheme, inspired by Java's 8 stream API. It allows users to process streams of data using a variety of operations, including filtering, mapping, folding, and more.

The library provides a set of functions for creating and manipulating streams, including functions for creating streams from lists, generating infinite streams, and concatenating multiple streams into a single one.

sflow also provides several higher-order functions for processing streams, such as filtering elements based on a predicate function, mapping elements to new values using a transformation function, and folding elements into a single value using an accumulator function.

With sflow, users can process streams of data in a functional and declarative style, making it easier to reason about and maintain code. The library is designed to be efficient and flexible, allowing users to process large streams of data with ease.

sflow is open source and available on GitHub under the MIT license. Contributions are welcome and encouraged!
